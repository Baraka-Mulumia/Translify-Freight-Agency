              You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to
              you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party
              Provider (“Charges”). After you have received services or goods
              obtained through your use of the Service, <b>Translify</b> will
              facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the
              Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited
              payment collection agent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same
              as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider.
              Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or
              surcharges including a booking fee, national, provincial and
              municipal tolls, airport surcharges and processing fees for split
              payments, and will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required
              by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless
              otherwise determined by <b>Translify</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party
              Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third
              Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods.
              <b>Translify</b> will respond accordingly to any request from a
              Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular
              service or good. All Charges are due immediately and payment will
              be facilitated by
              <b>Translify</b> using the preferred payment method designated in
              your Account, after which <b>Translify</b> will send you a receipt
              by email.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your primary Account payment method is determined to be
              expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree
              that <b>Translify</b>
              may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection
              agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if
              available. As between you and <b>Translify</b>, <b>Translify</b>
              reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for
              any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the
              Services at any time in
              <b>Translify</b>’s sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in
              certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times
              of high demand.
              <b>Translify</b> will use reasonable efforts to inform you of
              Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for
              Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness
              of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Translify</b> may from time to time provide certain users with
              promotional offers and discounts that may result in different
              amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained
              through the use of the Services, and you agree that such
              promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to
              you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the
              Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for
              services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to
              such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be
              charged a cancellation fee.
